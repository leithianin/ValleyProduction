  - See this watermill over there? It's a point of interest people will want to see,
    and a great place to spend the night! Not that I speak from personal experience.
    Of course. Errm, anyway, I'll teach you how to build a path to it.
  - "To build a path, you'll need the markers you can find in the building menu.
    These would normally cost you money, but since I\u2019m in a generous mood, I\u2019ll
    give you them for free this one time."
