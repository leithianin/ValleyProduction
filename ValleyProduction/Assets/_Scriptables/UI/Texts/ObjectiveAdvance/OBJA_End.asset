  title: YOU DID <color=#B8EF6F><size=70>WELL!
  texten: "Well... It seems you've grown up into a fine tree! \nThere's only one
    thing left for me to teach you. Remember that all we do, we are doing it for
    the valley. So that it may be as beautiful as it was when I was your age, beautiful
    enough to brighten up the hearts of animals and humans alike. \n\nThis old man's
    dream is in your capable hands now. But I know I won't be disappointed. I expect
    to look at you with a smile from my well-earned retirement! See you around the
    bush!"
