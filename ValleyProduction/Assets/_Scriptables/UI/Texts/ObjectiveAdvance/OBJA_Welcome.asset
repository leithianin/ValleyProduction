  title: TAKE CARE OF THE <color=#B8EF6F><size=70>VALLEY!
  texten: You'll now learn to take care of the environment just like you did for
    the visitors ! Well, the two are linked. But we could have all the visitors in
    the world, they wouldn't be able to see our dear bear if the valley isn't in
    good health. So we'll look at things from a more global perspective, to make
    sure this place becomes a real peace haven, like it was in my time. I'm counting
    on you to bring back that era ! I told you, the training wheels are off now,
    hahaha !
