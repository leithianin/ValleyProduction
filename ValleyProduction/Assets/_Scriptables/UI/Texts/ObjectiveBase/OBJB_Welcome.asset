  title: WELCOME TO THE <color=#B8EF6F><size=70>VALLEY!
  texten: 'Hello, young sapling ! How were your first steps in this natural park
    ? I hope you like it, because you''re in charge now ! As the manager, you''ll
    welcome visitors, do your best to please them, and take care of the flora and
    fauna. All that to bring back the valley''s former glory by reinserting it''s
    most famous resident : the bear ! I''ve been waiting for his return since my
    young days as a ranger... Hmmm ? You want to know who I am ? Ah, I thought you
    would never ask, but maybe you do know how to respect your elders. The name''s
    Woody, 67 years old, and as fresh as a spring breeze ! You''ll learn more about
    me as I pass all my knowledge about this place to you. And that''s a lot, so
    I''m here to stay !
