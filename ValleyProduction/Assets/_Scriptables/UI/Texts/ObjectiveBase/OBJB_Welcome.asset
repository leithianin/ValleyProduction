  title: WELCOME TO THE <color=#B8EF6F><size=70>VALLEY!
  texten: Hello, young sapling! As the new manager, you will develop this natural
    park depending on the visitors and the environment's needs. Let's do our best
    to bring this valley back to it's former glory! Mhmm ? You want to know who I
    am? I thought you would never ask, but maybe you do know how to respect your
    elders. The name's Woody, 67 years old, and as fresh as a spring breeze! To ensure
    that your first days go smoothly, I'll teach you all I know. And that's a lot,
    so I'm here to stay!
